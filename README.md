This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "JAGGED Controls Arabidopsis Petal Growth and Shape by Interacting with a Divergent Polarity Field"
Sauret-GÃ¼eto et al., PLoS Biol 11(4): e1001550. [doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001550)

The model is in the folder:

GPT\_Petal\_PLoS\_20130502

It can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
